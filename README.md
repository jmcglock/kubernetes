## Kubernetes
This repository contains a collection of Kubernetes deployment files, service files, ingress routes, and Helm charts for various applications.

# Getting Started
To use these Kubernetes files, you will need to have a Kubernetes cluster set up and running. You will also need to have the kubectl command-line tool installed on your local machine.

Once you have your Kubernetes cluster set up and kubectl installed, you can use the deployment files, service files, and ingress routes from this repository to deploy and manage your applications.

# Deployment Files
The deployment files in this repository are YAML files that define Kubernetes deployments for various applications. These files specify the containers to run, the number of replicas, and other configuration settings.

To use a deployment file, simply apply it to your Kubernetes cluster using the kubectl apply command:

kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml

# Service Files
The service files in this repository are YAML files that define Kubernetes services for various applications. These files specify the ports to expose, the type of service (ClusterIP, NodePort, LoadBalancer), and other configuration settings.

To use a service file, simply apply it to your Kubernetes cluster using the kubectl apply command:

kubectl apply -f service.yaml

# Ingress Routes
The ingress route files in this repository are YAML files that define Kubernetes ingress routes for various applications. These files specify the rules for routing traffic to the appropriate services and pods.

To use an ingress route file, simply apply it to your Kubernetes cluster using the kubectl apply command:

kubectl apply -f ingress.yaml

# Helm Charts
The Helm charts in this repository are templates that define Kubernetes deployments, services, and ingress routes for various applications. These charts can be used to deploy and manage applications on your Kubernetes cluster.

To use a Helm chart, you will need to have Helm installed on your local machine. Once you have Helm installed, you can use the Helm command-line tool to install the chart:

helm install myapp ./myapp-chart
