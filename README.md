## Kubernetes
This repository consists of a spectrum of Kubernetes deployment files, including service files, ingress routes, and Helm charts for different applications.

## Getting Started
To utilize these Kubernetes files, ensure you have a Kubernetes cluster established and functioning. The kubectl command-line tool needs to be installed on your local machine as well.

Upon setting up your Kubernetes cluster and installing kubectl, you can use deployment files, service files, and ingress routes, all present in this repository, for deploying and managing your applications.

## Deployment Files
The deployment files in this repository are YAML files. They define Kubernetes deployments for different applications. Within these files, you can specify the containers to run, the replicas needed, and other configuration settings.

To apply a deployment file to your Kubernetes cluster, use the kubectl apply command as shown:

```bash
kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
```

## Service Files
Service files in this repository are YAML files as well. They help define Kubernetes services for different applications. Configuration settings such as the ports to expose, the type of service (ClusterIP, NodePort, LoadBalancer), among others can be specified in these files.

To apply a service file to your Kubernetes cluster, use the kubectl apply command as shown:

```bash
kubectl apply -f service.yaml
```

## Ingress Routes
The ingress route files in this repository are YAML files. They define Kubernetes ingress routes for a variety of applications. It's within these files that rules for routing traffic to the right services and pods are specified.

To use an ingress route file, apply it to your Kubernetes cluster with the kubectl apply command:

```bash
kubectl apply -f ingress.yaml
```

## Helm Charts
Helm charts in this repository are templates that define Kubernetes deployments, services, and ingress routes for a variety of applications. These charts can be used to deploy and manage applications on your Kubernetes cluster.

To utilize a Helm chart, helm must be installed on your local machine. With Helm installed, the Helm command-line tool can be employed to install the chart:

```bash
helm install myapp ./myapp-chart
```
